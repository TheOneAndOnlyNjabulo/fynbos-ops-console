"""
Manual test script for the retrieval function - run via CLI:
    cd backend
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/test_retrieval.py

Runs a handful of sample questions against the live Pinecone index and prints
the top matches, so retrieval quality can be eyeballed before it's wired into
any of the four agent modules.
